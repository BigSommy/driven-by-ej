# Driven by EJ — Smart Car Deals

Local development

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This project uses a lightweight Sanity client wrapper (`src/lib/sanityClient.ts`) that falls back to `data/cars.json` when no Sanity config is provided.
- Update `data/cars.json` with real cars and add images to `public/` for development.
- WhatsApp number is configured to `+234 812 723 0704` in header/footer/CTAs.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
