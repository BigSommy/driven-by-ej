1. PROJECT BRIEF
Project Name: Driven by EJ – Smart Car Deals
Product Type: Mobile-first car marketplace & trust website
Primary Platform: Web (mobile-first, desktop supported)
Background & Purpose
Driven by EJ is a modern digital car dealership built to solve a very Nigerian problem: people want cars, but they don’t trust dealers and they don’t understand payment plans.
Most car dealers rely on Instagram DMs and word of mouth. This project upgrades that flow by creating a central, professional website where customers can:
See real cars clearly
Understand how installment payments work
Trust the dealer behind the brand
Message instantly on WhatsApp to close the deal
The website should feel like Instagram meets a proper dealership, with clarity around pricing and installment options being the main competitive advantage.
Goals
The website is designed to do four main things:
Build instant trust
Clearly show available cars and prices
Explain payment plans without confusion
Push fast action through WhatsApp
If a visitor lands on the site and doesn’t buy immediately, they should at least message on WhatsApp.
Target Audience
The core users are Nigerians who:
• Want to buy foreign used or Nigerian used cars
• May not have full payment upfront
• Are skeptical of car dealers and scams
• Use mobile phones primarily
• Are already comfortable chatting on WhatsApp
This includes young professionals, business owners, first-time car buyers, and people upgrading their cars.
Success Metrics
The project is successful if:
• Visitors easily understand payment plans
• WhatsApp clicks increase
• Car inquiries become more qualified
• Trust perception improves (people reference the website during chats)
• Testimonials and delivered cars increase conversions
